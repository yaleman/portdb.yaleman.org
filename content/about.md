A network port database mini site. I was driven mad by the lack of information on ports and the applications they map to, so I've started this database for my own information.

Please feel free to add information, by emailing me at [yaleman@ricetek.net](mailto:yaleman@ricetek.net)

# Todo

* Fix the protocol pages so they aren't Tcps and Udps
* Make some scripts to collect data automagically for the site.
